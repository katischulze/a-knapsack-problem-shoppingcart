# a-knapsack-problem-shoppingcart
the knapsack problem is np-hard and famously unsolved. I was once tasked with actually solving a problem that falls into the knapsack but I had to tell them that I would not be working for them if I knew how to solve a problem no one was able to solve. However, still intrigued I still tried to make an algorithm that would solve the problem and it works. It will just literally take forever and might crash your PC but it's about the spirit of it all. Who knows, maybe one day I will actually solve the knapsack problem and will get rich and famous.
